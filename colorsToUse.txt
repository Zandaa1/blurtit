## GitHub Copilot Context File for Color Palette

Based on the provided image, here is a `context.txt` file that describes the design system's color palette. This file can be used with GitHub Copilot to help it suggest the correct colors and their corresponding hex codes for your project.

### About this Context File

This file defines the project's color palette, organizing it by category and purpose. The primary categories are:

  * **Highlight:** A vibrant blue for primary actions and highlights.
  * **Neutral:** Grayscale tones for backgrounds, text, and borders.
  * **Support:** Colors for specific states like success, warning, and error.

Each color entry includes the category name, a descriptive label, and the hex code. This structured information allows Copilot to intelligently suggest the appropriate color for a given task, such as a "primary button color," "success message background," or "dark text."
